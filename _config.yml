  I do:
  * Boxing - started it recently. In videogames it's been much easier.
  * Sailing - I've sailed on small boats for years, but I have to admit that windsurfing is a lot more funnier for me.
  * Playing guitar - I play all the campfire songs and mix them with Metallica \m/
  * Snowboarding - because everybody does.
