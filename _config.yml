      I do:
        * Boxing - started it recently. In videogames it's been much easier.
        * Sailing - I've sailed on small boats for years, but I have to admit that windsurfing is a lot more funnier for me.
        * Playing guitar - I play all the campfire songs and mix them with Metallica \m/
        * Snowboarding - because everybody does.
